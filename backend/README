1. Firstly, you have to initialize the project. execute command `npm install`,
2. When all packages are installed, you can run project with `npm start`. Main file is in `./src/app.ts`. You can make changes without restarting server - NODEMON is refreshing every change after file save. 
3. Project is using `eslint` to check code, so if IDE is yelling about errors in code try to run `npm run eslint` or set your IDE to run eslint after every save.
